What you are allowed to do: 
redistribute
It is prefered you don't sell any of these textures in a standalone pack or put any of these behind a website like adfoc.us, etc. Not a requirement but I'd prefer not.
You can use these textures if you struggle to make them yourself. Or you just like the theme.
You can use this in youtube videos and the like.


Requirments:
You must redistribute with this license. File put in one of the files.
You must give proper credit (Give credit to all people listed on the github contributors section for the repo, and give a link to the github repo. And all of this must be in a well defined place.)


Notes:
This license offers no waranty of any kind.
This license may be subject to change at any time.
This license allows for some commercial use. Ex. Videos and games using some assets.

That being said. Enjoy the pack :)
